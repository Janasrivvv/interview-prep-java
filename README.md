# Interview Prep – Java Backend

This repository documents my learning journey while preparing for Java backend interviews.
It contains concise notes, examples, and reflections as my understanding evolves over time.

## Purpose
- Build strong fundamentals in Java and backend concepts
- Prepare in a structured but flexible way for technical interviews
- Create a single place to return to, even after breaks

## How this repository is used
- Notes are written in my own words
- Content may be incomplete or evolve over time
- The focus is on clarity and understanding, not perfection

## Scope (will grow gradually)
- Java core fundamentals
- OOP concepts
- Collections and basics of concurrency
- Spring Boot fundamentals
- Microservices concepts
- SQL and basic DSA (interview-oriented)

## Rules I follow
- Progress over perfection
- No restarting the repository
- Small, consistent updates instead of long gaps

## Log
(Used to note return points after breaks or quick status updates)
